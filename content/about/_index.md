I am in my final year of my PhD at the [AILS Laboratory][1-new] of the [National Technical University of Athens][2-new], focusing on advancing the field of Natural Language Processing. My research also aims to develop explainable AI algorithms that can clarify the internal mechanisms of black-box models. Specializing in NLP, I have extensively explored its integration with explainable AI, working on projects involving deep learning techniques, counterfactual explanations, and evaluation metrics tailored to text-based data. My expertise further extends to knowledge representation and reasoning, with a significant portion of my work dedicated to enhancing the interpretability and security of NLP models.

You can find my CV [here][CV].
