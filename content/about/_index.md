I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [AILS laboratory][https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/] of the [National Technical University of Athens][2-new]. The objective of my research is to develop eXplainable AI algorithms that can elucidate the internal mechanisms of black-box models or create foundational models that are more user-friendly and secure. I have gained experience in various aspects of AI, including deep learning with NLP, Counterfactual Explanations, Evaluation Metrics, and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning with automatic reasoning, among others.


You can find my CV [here][CV].


Previous semesters I had had fun TA'ing "Artificial Intelligence", "Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics" and "Machine Learning".

In the summer of 2022, I was a research scientist intern at DeepMind in London, where I was lucky to spend four months working with [Junyoung Chung][junyoung], [Nate Kushman][nate], and [AÃ¤ron van den Oord][aaron].

Before my PhD, I was a research engineer at [Samsung's AI Center][5] in New York City, where I learned constantly from [Volkan Isler][6], [Daniel D. Lee][7], and many other wonderful (and patient) people. As an undergraduate, I completed my thesis under the guidance of [H. Sebastian Seung][10] after many hours in the [Seung Lab][8] at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute][9]. I also competed for [Princeton's varsity men's golf team][X].

In my free time, I make music for guitar and voice. I enjoy the outdoors, particularly golf courses and mountains.
