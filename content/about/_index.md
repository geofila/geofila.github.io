I am currently in the final year of my PhD at the [AILS Laboratory][1-new] of the [National Technical University of Athens][2-new]. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In NLP, I have worked on various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, and discourse analysis. My work in XAI centers on providing semantic explanations about the decision-making processes of AI models, in different forms like counterfactuals and prototypical explanations.

My passion is exploring new ideas and conducting high-quality research that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge. I am always eager to collaborate with others in new and fascinating research projects. If you are interested in my work, feel free to reach out to me.

You can find my CV [here][CV].
